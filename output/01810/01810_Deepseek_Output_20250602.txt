### **Fundamental Analysis Key Points**  
1. **Company-Specific:**  
   - **Strong Q1 Earnings:** Revenue +47% YoY, gross margin record 22.8%, EV deliveries (28K SU7 in May).  
   - **YU7 Catalyst:** July mass production expected; pre-launch hype could drive sentiment.  
   - **Risks:** Baidu lawsuit (June 13), Huawei’s public criticism of quality standards.  

2. **Industry/Macro:**  
   - **Government Subsidies:** Beneficiary of consumer electronics/EV incentives (per Bernstein, CCB).  
   - **EV Competition:** Price wars persist (industry利润率降至3.9%), but Xiaomi’s brand strength offsets risks.  
   - **Macro:** HK retail slump (-2.3% YoY) and US tariff threats weigh on broader market sentiment.

### **News Sentiment Analysis**  
1. **Positive Sentiment (60%):**  
   - Target price hikes (CCB: ¥67; Bernstein: ¥60) on strong earnings and subsidies.  
   - YU7 production updates (July timeline) and SU7 delivery stability (28K/month).  

2. **Negative Sentiment (30%):**  
   - Baidu lawsuit (June 13) over "unfair competition."  
   - Huawei’s余承东质疑小米汽车质量 ("not up to Huawei standards").  

3. **Neutral (10%):**  
   - Industry debates on EV "price war" sustainability.  

**Overall:** Sentiment leans positive but tempered by legal/competitive risks.

### **Comprehensive Evaluation**  
1. **Short-Term (5 days):**  
   - Technicals suggest consolidation; sentiment mixed (legal vs. YU7 hype).  
   - **Action:** Hold; enter long if breaks ¥51.75 (target ¥54) or buy dips near ¥49.50 (stop-loss ¥48).  

2. **Mid-Term (30 days):**  
   - Fundamentals dominate: YU7 launch, subsidies, and EV growth support upside.  
   - **Action:** Buy; PT ¥67 (CCB’s bull case) if YU7 execution succeeds.
